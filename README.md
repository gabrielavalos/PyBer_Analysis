* Urban 
  * bring in the most money in late February
  * total fares flunctuate from late February peak to April
* Suburban 
  * bring in the most money in late February
  * total fares decrease after the late February peak
* Rural 
  * bring in the most money in April
  * total fares flunctuate the least 
## Summary
1. Add more drivers to rural city types to see the effect on the Total Rides
2. Continue to add more drivers to rural cities to see at if at anypoint the average fare per ride decreases
